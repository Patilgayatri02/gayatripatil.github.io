  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a final-year Bachelor of Engineering student in Electronics and
    Telecommunication Engineering from Sinhgad Institute of Technology &
    Science, Pune, with a CGPA of 8.66. Alongside my academic coursework,
    I have developed a strong interest in software development and
    problem-solving.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have practical experience in mobile application development using
    Flutter and Firebase, where I worked on building responsive user
    interfaces and managing real-time data. My academic and project
    experience has also strengthened my understanding of Core Java,
    Object-Oriented Programming concepts, and database integration using
    JDBC and MySQL.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them by developing
    real-world applications. Currently, I am focusing on improving my
    skills in data structures, software development best practices, and
    writing clean, maintainable code. I am actively seeking
    opportunities where I can gain hands-on experience, contribute to
    meaningful projects, and grow as a software developer.
